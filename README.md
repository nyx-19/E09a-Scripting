# E09a-Scripting

this godot file adds into it small text aditions that help make this game feel less like a proof of concept and more like a game. It now counts score as you eliminate blocks and counts lives. Once lives run out, the player will get a screan that reads: "game over!" There was a problem with the blocks for me, but found out it was a quick fix of a typo in one of the scripts.
